# Determine the cervical cancer factors in R

### A brief introduction

This project is an attempt to identify the cause(s) of cervical cancer. Many variables (factors) were recorded and most are inconclusive. Three different statistical models (linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression analysis) were compared to each other and the best model was used to identify the cause(s) for cervical. The model chosen suggested that the most predictive factors for cervical cancer are HPV (positive) and the length of smoking (in years, with a positive correlation).

### Check my work

- I created this project using R Markdown in R Studio using this [code file](cervical-cancer-factor-with-R-markdown.Rmd).
- A [bibliography file](cervical-cancer-bibliography.bib) is necessary to do live citation in R studio and create a reference page. Make sure the bibliography file is in the same folder as your R markdown file.
- You also need to download and put these [csv](risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv) [files](risk_factors_cervical_cancer1.csv) in the same folder. These files were cleaned (some columns were removed without modifying any of the data) from the original dataset on the [UC Irvine Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29).
